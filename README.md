## What Is Laravel TestBench?

Laravel TestBench provides some testing functionality for [Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com).

* Laravel TestBench was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).
* Laravel TestBench relies on [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) and the [Orchestral Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench) package.
* Laravel TestBench provides a [change log](CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-TestBench/releases), and [api docs](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-TestBench).
* Laravel TestBench is licensed under the Apache License, available [here](LICENSE.md).


## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.4.7+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.1+ and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel TestBench, simply require `"graham-campbell/testbench": "~1.0"` in your `composer.json` file. You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Laravel TestBench is installed, you can extend or implement the classes in this package, or packages required by this package. The AbstractTestCase class would be a good place to start. There are no service providers to register.


## Configuration

Laravel TestBench requires no configuration. Just follow the simple install instructions and go!


## Usage

There is currently no usage documentation besides the [API Documentation](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-TestBench
) for Laravel TestBench.

You may see an example of implementation in pretty much all of my [Laravel](http://laravel.com) packages.
